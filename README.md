# Özgür's Popular Movies!

This is a project I've worked on that fetches the top 100 popular movies from themoviedb.org.

# Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Make sure to create a `.env` file in the root of the repo that consists of your API KEY in a variable called REACT_APP_API_KEY. I have created a `.env.example` that show you how it should be done, change "Your_API_Key_Here" for your API-key from themoviedb.org. Make sure you edit the `.env` file and not the `.env.example` file!
4. To get an API key from themoviedb.org follow their guide: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
5. When your API key is in place run:

```sh
npm start
```

6. Happy browsing the top movies!
